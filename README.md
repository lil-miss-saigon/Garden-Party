# Garden-Party
A complex gardening adventure, not for the faint of heart!

Garden Party is an ad-free project built and maintained by Zachary Reich. The goal of the game is to survive a relentless onslaught by Mother Nature herself. Maximize your garden's efficiency with strategies you learn along the way, and don't forget to have fun!
